          <p class = "lead"> Hey, nice to meet you! I'm Oliver, a tennis player, rock climber, programmer, designer, and student at the University of Michigan. Throughout college, I was pretty clueless about what I wanted to do it upon myself to try anything and everything. Over time, I found my initial home in <a style ={{textDecoration: 'none'}}  target= "_blank" href ="https://ioe.engin.umich.edu/">IOE, where I learned that I enjoy streamlining frustratingly inefficient processes</a>. 
          After my sophomore year, I did a data science internship at Principal Financial Group, where I learned that I love creating 
          accessible and intuitive user experiences and making data-driven decisions.  <a style ={{textDecoration: 'none'}}  target= "_blank" href = "https://www.si.umich.edu/about-umsi"> I then decided to take on an additional major through the School of Information in Applied Data Science & User Experience Design. 
          </a> After gaining some rudimentary programming skills, I realized it was paramount to have a foundation in computer science to have a solid understanding of core engineering principles so that I could build products from the ground up myself.  <a target = "_blank" style ={{textDecoration: 'none'}} href = "https://cse.engin.umich.edu/"> Somehow, I also managed to tack on a minor in computer science in addition to my dual degree with a concentration in User Interface Design. </a>
          My interdisciplinary studies in engineering, business, and design have lead me to be really interested in a career in 
          product management/operations/analytics roles. </p>
