### 👨‍💻 Oliver's Personal Website

Hey! Welcome to my personal website GitHub. This website was built in a few days using React and Bootstrap. Used what I learn from classes and gained a lot coding it from scratch. I learned a lot about how frameworks like Bootstrap really ease the process of making things responsive, beautiful, and accessible.
