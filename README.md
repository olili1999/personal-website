### 👨‍💻 Oliver's Personal Website

https://olili.me

Hey! This GitHub repository holds the code I used to build my portfolio. This website was built in around a week using React and Bootstrap. I used what I learn from classes and learned a ton by building everything from scratch. I learned a lot about how frameworks like Bootstrap really ease the process of making things responsive, beautiful, and accessible.
